# Yelp Data Analysis
Toronto is one of the biggest food cities in the world. 
We have several top restaurants and some amazing ethnic cuisine due to our multicultural makeup. 
I am looking to explore the food scene in Toronto using neighborhood profile information from the 2016 census and open data provided by Yelp about restaurants, 
particularly in the Toronto area. I am looking to identify if thereâ€™s any trends related to neighborhood profile information (average income level, ethnic makeup, etc.) and distribution of restaurants by price and ratings.
